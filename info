Auto power-on after boot
By default, the Bluetooth adapter does not power on after a reboot, you need to add the line AutoEnable=true in the configuration file /etc/bluetooth/main.conf at the bottom in the [Policy] section:

/etc/bluetooth/main.conf
[Policy]
AutoEnable=true

Linux kernel 5.9.1 broke bluetoot reconnect on my mx master 3

I am using Intel AX200 and Logitech MX Master 2S and since upgrading to 5.9.1 I had to reconnect my mouse after every reboot.
After removing

[IdentityResolvingKey]
Key=CDF...
from

/var/lib/bluetooth/<MAC>/<MAC>/info
and a reboot manual reconnection is not needed anymore. I rebooted twice, the issue looks like its fixed.
